Foundations_HTML-project
This project is to combine all of the HTML skills I have learned so far. It will also be the first use of Git and the GitHub in a live setting, and will reinforce what I've learned previously. For HTML, I will have ordered and unordered lists, links, and images, all under appropriately sized headings.
